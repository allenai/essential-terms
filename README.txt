This is the dataset accompanying the following submission:

	Learning What is Essential in Questions, Submitted to EMNLP-2017. 

The .tsv file contains the questions and their annotations. 
Each line has one single question, followed by its number of annotators and the essentiality scores of its constituents. 
Here is an example

	If an object is attracted to a magnet, the object is most likely made of (A) wood (B) plastic (C) cardboard (D) metal 	5	If,0|an,0|object,3|is,0|attracted,5|to,0|a,0|magnet,,5|the,0|object,1|is,0|most,0|likely,0|made,2|of,0

where the multiple-choice question is "If an object is attracted to ...", it is annotated by 5 turkers, 
and the scores raw essentiality scores are "If,0|an,0|object,3|is,0|attracted,5 ...".
